This includes files for Project #1 CIVE 202
Description:
This project looks at air quality data from several sensors to see where and when pollution levels were the highest. We analyzed VOC, PM2.5, and PM10 values and checked how temperature and humidity might affect air quality. We also identified days that could be unhealthy for sensitive groups based on EPA guidelines. The goal of this project is to help UNMC better understand air quality patterns around their locations.
